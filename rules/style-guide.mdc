# Writing style guide

## Voice

The Matchbox voice strives to be concise, direct and precise. The goal is to provide information that is easy to search and scan.

The voice in documentation should be conversational but brief, friendly but succinct.

## Language

Matchbox documentation should be clear and easy to understand. The guidelines below help us achieve this goal through consistency.

- Avoid unnecessary words.
- Be clear, concise and stick to the goal of the topic.
- Write in active voice.
- Write in the imparative mood when giving commands, instructions, making requests or giving warnings.
- Write in the present tense.
- Write in US English with US grammar.
- Do not use emojis in documentation or code comments.

## Acronyms

- If you use an acronym, spell it out in its first use on the page.
- You do not need to spell it out more than once on a page.
- When possible, avoid acronyms in headings.

## Capitalization

- Use sentence case for headings.
- Capitalize the first word of each list item.

## UI text

- When referring to specific user interface text, like a button label or menu item, use the same capitalization displayed in the user interface.

## Emphasis

- Use bold rather than italic to provide emphasis.

## Lists

- Always start list items with a capital letter.
- End each list item with a period.
- Majority rules. Use either full sentences or all fragments. Avoid a mix.
- Use a period after every sentence. Do not use commas or semicolons.
- Use ordered lists for a sequence of steps.
- Use unordered lists when the steps do not need to be completed in order.

### Order

- Use alphabetical order when the sequence is not important.

## Numbers

- When using numbers in text, spell out zero through nine, and use numbers for 10 and greater or anything less than zero.
- When starting a heading with a number, use the number followed by a period and a space (e.g., "1. Introduction" not "1 Introduction").

## Punctuation

- End full sentences with a period.
- End questions with a question mark.
- Do not use repetitive punctuation at the end of a sentence.
- Do not use serial (Oxford) commas before the final “and” or “or” in a list of three or more.
- Use one space between sentences.
- Do not use non-breaking spaces. Use standard spaces instead.

## Formatting

- Do not change the text color.
- Use “Align left” text alignment.
- Use tab to indent, not spaces.

### Markdown

- End each file with a blank line.
- Add a blank line after a heading.
- Add a blank line befor a list.
